# Come Code with Me - My Coding Journey

"Come Code with Me" is a fictional blog created by a Web Application Development student, who shares her coding journey, discoveries, and insights into the tech world. From hackathons and coding challenges to embracing new technologies, she writes about the triumphs and tribulations of her educational odyssey.

The site consists of three pages: Home (where the blog author introduces herself), Blog (where all the blog posts are located), and Sign In/Up. The Sign In/Up page allows users to create a new account or log into an existing one. If you're already signed in, you'll see the Sign Out option in the navbar, allowing you to log out of your account. Adding comments to blog posts, as well as editing or deleting them, is only available to registered users. Adding new blog posts, editing, and deleting them are functionalities restricted to an admin.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme of "Come Code with Me" was derived from its background image and the main home page picture â€” an AI-generated, animated image of the blog author. Given its crucial role in setting the tone and atmosphere of the site, I aimed for it to mirror the ambiance of late-night coding sessions, often accompanied by a comforting cup of coffee. The dominant black evokes the nocturnal atmosphere, symbolizing the late hours spent immersed in code. White, representing clarity and focus, enhances readability and emphasizes the clean lines of the design. Beige and brown shades evoke the warmth of coffee, providing a sense of comfort during intense coding sessions. Together, these colors create an inviting and cozy environment, inspiring productivity and creativity while capturing the essence of late-night coding rituals.

I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/ffffff-ad7c54-9b5720-8f501d-3f1403-000000) to generate my colour palette.

![Colour Palette](documentation/colour_palette.png)

### Typography

The combination of well-matching Stint Ultra Expanded and Pontano Sans fonts was suggested by one of the font pairing services called [fontpair.co](https://www.fontpair.co/). These fonts create a great contrast in a harmonising way. They enhance the visual hierarchy of the website and highlight essential information.

The [Stint Ultra Expanded](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Stint+Ultra+Expanded) is a font designed for digital use, characterized by its expanded letterforms and distinctive appearance. It features wider letterforms compared to standard fonts. This expansion provides a unique visual style that makes it a perfect choice for headings and titles.

The [Pontano Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pontano+Sans) is a contemporary sans-serif font that features a clean and modern design with minimalistic letterforms. Pontano Sans prioritizes legibility, making it easy to read even at small sizes. Its balanced proportions, contemporary aesthetic and clean lines ensure clear communication of text. It was used for blog posts' content.

![Font Pairing](documentation/fonts.png)

Additionally, a [Sacramento](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sacramento) font was introduced specifically for messages directly from the blog author. The selection of this font was deliberate, as it perfectly imitates handwriting and adds a personal touch to the website, which creates a welcoming and approachable tone, making it ideal for conveying the author's thoughts, reflections, and updates in a warm and engaging manner.

![Sacramento Font](documentation/sacramento.png)

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons were used throughout the site, such as social media icons in the footer, or visual representations of forms' input fields.

### Imagery

Images play a crucial role in enhancing the overall user experience, making the content more engaging. However, the website currently features only two: the background picture and the animated representation of the blog owner on the home page. This limitation stems from the fact that each blog post will include a featured image, added by the blog owner while composing the remaining content, to represent its main topic. Such images will be showcased in both blog post previews and the full post pages.

The background picture was sourced from the leading provider of stock photography, [Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/).

![Background Image](documentation/shutterstock_2189462235.webp)

The animated image of the blog owner was AI-generated using [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home?callbackUrl=%2Fexplore).

![Home Page Picture](static/images/come_code_with_me_2.png)

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) - the industry's top wireframing software.

### Features

#### Existing Features

"Come Code with Me" consists of three pages: Home (where the blog author introduces herself), Blog (where all the blog posts are located), and Sign In/Up. The Sign In/Up page allows users to create a new account or log into an existing one. If you're already signed in, you'll see the Sign Out option in the navbar (replacing the Sign In/Up), allowing you to log out of your account. 

Adding comments to blog posts, as well as editing or deleting them, is only available to registered users. Adding new blog posts, editing, and deleting them are functionalities restricted to an admin.

Some features are common to all of the pages. These include:

- **Page Header** - It features a centered logo comprising the blog's name and a subtitle in capital letters (notably smaller in size). Positioned in the top right corner is a responsive navigation element that collapses into a hamburger menu on medium and small devices. Links to all three pages change colour when hovered over by a user. The collapsed menu also contains links to all three pages. Upon clicking or tapping, the menu smoothly slides into view. The responsive navigation header was constructed using the MaterializeCSS framework. The header background has a translucent appearance, offering a subtle view of the background picture behind it.

![Header expanded](documentation/header.png)
![Sidenav](documentation/sidenav.png)
![Header collapsed](documentation/header_collapsed.png)

- **Page Footer** - It stretches across the entire width of the screen and consists of copyright information and social media links, both centered on all screen sizes. Social media icons change their color when a user hovers over them.

![Page Footer on large devices](documentation/footer_large.png)
![Page Footer on small devices](documentation/footer_small.png)

- **Flashed Messages Container** - It plays a crucial role in enhancing the user experience by providing timely and relevant feedback to users as they interact with the website.  It is centered across all device sizes and matches the website's design.

![Flashed message 1](documentation/flash_1.png)
![Flashed message 2](documentation/flash_2.png)

The **Home Page** features an AI-generated, animated image of the blog owner, providing a visually engaging introduction to the site. Alongside this, users are greeted with a brief, welcoming message. In this message, the blog owner introduces herself, offers an overview of the blog's purpose and topics, and defines its target audience. The message serves as a friendly invitation for users to explore further and engage with the blog's content.

![Home Page](documentation/homepage.png)

The **Sign-Up Page** allows you to create an account using just a username and password. If the username is already in use, an error message will prompt you to select an alternative. Signing up is necessary if you want to add comments to blog posts. Registered users can also edit and delete their own comments. This straightforward process makes it easy to join the community and start interacting with blog content.

![Sign-Up Page](documentation/sign_up.png) 

The **Sign-In Page** enables users to access their accounts by entering their correct username and password. If the provided credentials are incorrect, an error message will prompt users to try again. Visually consistent with the Sign-Up page, the Sign-In page offers a familiar interface for seamless navigation.

![Sign-In Page](documentation/sign_in.png)

Upon logging in, users are directed to the **Welcome Page**, providing a customized greeting featuring their username for a more personal touch. This page succinctly outlines the benefits and privileges available to registered users. It serves as an informative resource, offering insights into the advantages of being part of the platform.

![Welcome Page](documentation/welcome_page.png)

The **Blog Posts Page** offers concise previews of full blog posts, showcasing essential details such as category, date created, an accompanying image, and the blog post headline. For a seamless user experience, a "READ MORE" link redirects users to the corresponding full post page. If the blog post author chooses to display the post as 'NEW', a green envelope will appear before the blog headline. Hovering over it will trigger a tooltip displaying the message 'NEW POST!'.

Utilizing MaterializeCSS and its responsive grid system, the layout adapts dynamically across devices. On large screens, three cards are neatly organized in a row, two on medium-sized devices, and a single card on smaller screens.

Admin users benefit from additional functionalities. Below each post preview, dedicated "Edit" and "Delete" buttons provide streamlined content management. Moreover, an easily accessible "Add Blog Post" button appears prominently in the center of the page. For security and a personalized experience, non-admin users won't encounter these buttons or access the associated features.

![Blog Posts Page](documentation/blog_posts_preview.png)

The **Read Post Page** serves as the platform for displaying complete blog posts, fostering engagement through user comments. Registered users have the ability to interact by leaving comments, with the option to edit or delete their own contributions. When users choose to edit or delete their comments, a modal window appears, requesting confirmation before proceeding.

![Read Post Page](documentation/read_post.png)
![Modal Edit](documentation/modal_edit.png)
![Modal Delete](documentation/modal_delete.png)


The **Add New Blog Post Page** presents an intuitive form for creating new blog posts. Users begin by selecting a category from the dropdown menu and then proceed to fill in the blog post headline, body text, and image URL path. A convenient datepicker simplifies setting the creation date. Users can toggle an option to flag the post as "new" before finalizing their submission. With all details entered, users submit the post, seamlessly adding it to the MongoDB database.

![Add New Blog Post Page](documentation/add_blog_post.png)

And finally, the **Edit Existing Blog Post Page** utilizes the same form as described above, pre-filled with previously entered information. At the bottom of the page, users encounter two buttons: one to save the changes and the other to discard them.

![Edit Existing Blog Post Page](documentation/edit_blog_post.png)

## Database Design

My project uses a non-relational database with MongoDB, and therefore the database architecture
doesn't have actual relationships like a relational database would.

My database is called **coding_blog**.

It contains 4 collections:

- **categories**
    | Key | Type | Notes |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | _id | ObjectId() | |
    | category_name | String | |

- **blog_posts**
    | Key | Type | Notes |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | _id | ObjectId() | |
    | category_name | String | selected from *categories* collection |
    | headline | String | |
    | post_body | String | |
    | image_url | String | |
    | date_created | String | |
    | is_new | String | |

- **users**
    | Key | Type | Notes |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | _id | ObjectId() | |
    | username | String | |
    | password | String | uses Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) |

- **comments**
    | Key | Type | Notes |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | _id | ObjectId() | |
    | comment_content | String | |
    | blog_post_id | ObjectId() | copied from *blog_posts* collection |
    | username | String | |


## Testing

For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://come-code-with-me-43691c30d81d.herokuapp.com).

### MongoDB Non-Relational Database

This project uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) for the Non-Relational Database.

To obtain your own MongoDB Database URI, sign-up on their site, then follow these steps:

- The name of the database on MongoDB should be called **coding_blog**.
- The collections needed for this database should be **categories**, **blog_posts**, **users** and **comments**.
- Click on the **Cluster** name created for the project.
- Click on the **Connect** button.
- Click **Connect Your Application**.
- Copy the connection string, and replace `password` with your own password (also remove the angle-brackets).

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `IP` | 0.0.0.0 |
| `MONGO_DBNAME` | user's own value |
| `MONGO_URI` | user's own value |
| `PORT` | 5000 |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.

- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: python app.py > Procfile`
- *replace **app.py** with the name of your primary Flask app name; the one at the root-level*

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.


You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps, plus a few extras.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("IP", "0.0.0.0")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "5000")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DB_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
os.environ.setdefault("DEVELOPMENT", "True")
```

#### Cloning

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/NataliaCzeladka/come-code-with-me) 
2. Locate the Code button above the list of files and click it 
3. Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard
4. Open Git shell or Terminal
5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory
6. In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone my repository:

A tutorial on how to do that can be found [here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension).

#### Forking

By forking the GitHub Repository, we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository.
You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/NataliaCzeladka/come-code-with-me)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account!

## Credits

### Code

- The website was created following a series of videos recorded by Tim Nelson, a mentor at Code Institute. Some of the code snippets used in these videos were also applied while creating my own full-stack application.

- Code for the outline effect used on multiple occasions across the CSS stylesheet was taken from [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4919076/outline-effect-to-text) and was slightly edited to fit the project's needs.

- The code for a sticky footer, which remains at the bottom of the page regardless of the amount of content, was adopted from [Materialize's](https://materializecss.com/footer.html) website. Additionally, various pre-built elements from Materialize were utilized, including the responsive navbar, form input fields, tooltips, datepicker, and modals.

- The code for the Login Required Decorator was sourced from the [Flask Documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/patterns/viewdecorators/#login-required-decorator).

### Content

The website demonstrates great potential, and I'm considering using it as my own personal blog in the future. However, due to time limitations in creating this project, I've utilized ChatGPT to generate text content for the blog posts (excluding any code), enabling me to concentrate on other aspects of the website's development and customization.
